	<h3>The exchange student</h3>


	<p>
		After a couple of years studying English, you finally decide to face the challenge of travelling to a country where English is the first language. It appears to be simply great and it is, but you have got to take lots of decisions before going.The first decision is to choose the country. There are many possibilities; however you need to take just one. To make it easier, you should think about the pros and cons each country has.</p>

	<p>	Consider the weather to make your choice easier. Some countries such as the USA and Canada seem to be perfect because of the distance from Brazil and the time zone, however from November to April, depending on the city you choose, you will freeze. So, think carefully when you are going.</p>
	<p> Australia and New Zealand are simply wondful, though the time zone may be one problem to some people; thirteen and fifteen hours forward respectively. It seems to be nothing, but when you travel to one of these countries, your sensation is like two days travelling.</p>

	<p> South Africa is a paradise. It has beautiful and exotic beaches and places. Their currency is named Rand and it is worth about one seventh of one American dollar. It looks perfect, but take care with the language spoken there. It is English, but the accent is very strong and commercially speaking, I don’t think it’s so attractive.</p>

	<p> Europe is amazing and you have got many options. England is the first one in many students’ minds; however you have Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Well my friend, if your choice is one of these countries, I’ll have to say: Welcome to the euro zone. England uses both pound and euro, but all the prices will be in pound and it’s about fifteen percent more expensive than euro. In Ireland you will be very luck if you see a sunny day. It rains about three hundred days per year.</p>

	<p>So, if you wanna be an exchange student, you must pay attention to all details and then after you think about packing your luggage.</p>

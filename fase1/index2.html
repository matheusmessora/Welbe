	<h3>2. SOME: It is an adjective and used most of the times with plural nouns or uncountable nouns.</h3>
	<p>Example: I have some friends. I would like some water, please.</p>

	<p>We quite often use some to form a new word like: somebody, someone or something. It is very important to remember that they are considered 3rd person of the singular and are mostly used in affirmative or interrogative sentences (expecting YES in the answer).<br />
		Example: I think there is somebody at the door. Does someone here want to get a free ticket to Paris?</p>

	<h3>3. ANY: It is an adjective and used mostly in the way of: “it does not matter which.” Or one or more without specification or identification.</h3>
	<p>Example: You can get any bus, because they all go downtown.<br />If you have any witnesses, produce them.</p>

	<p>We usually use any to form a new word like: anybody, anyone and anything. They are also considered 3rd person of the singular and require special attention. They are often used in interrogative and negative forms, but sometimes used in affirmative one.</p>

	<p>Example: Does anybody know where Loraine is? <br />There is not anything to be done over here.<br /> If there is anything I can do for you, please just let me know.</p>

	<h3>4. NO ONE, NOBODY AND NOTHING</h3>
	<p>They are used in affirmative sentences with negative meanings.</p>

	<p>Example: I know nothing about John. = I do not know anything about John.<br />
		There is nobody here better than me. = There is not anybody here better than me.</p>

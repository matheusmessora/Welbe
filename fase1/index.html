	<h3>1. COUNTABLE AND UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS</h3>
	<p>When we talk about countable and uncountable things, weâ€™d better imagine singular and plural, because most of the times we need to use adjectives like: MUCH / MANY / LITTLE / FEW / A LITTLE / A FEW</p>

	<p>- Much is the opposite of little and expresses a great quantity. It is used in singular.<br />
		Example: I do not drink much water. I drink little water. </p>

	<p>- Many is the opposite of few and expresses a great quantity. It is used in plural.<br />
		Example: I do not have many friends. I have few friends.</p>

	<p>- A lot / lots of: They are informally used to replace many or much.<br />
		Example: I have a lot of friends. I drink lots of water.</p>

	<p>- A little or a few are used when we mean that we do not have a great quantity of something, however it is enough.<br />
		Example: Do you speak English Michel? I speak a little. So, we can talk a bit. (In this sentence the person means that his English is not excellent, but possible to communicate)<br />
		You have a few minutes to finish the test. (Not many minutes, but enough to finish it)</p>

	<p>- Very is an adverb and is used before adjectives.<br />
		Example: She is a very beautiful girl. (Not much beautiful)</p>
